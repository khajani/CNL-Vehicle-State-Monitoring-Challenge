# ðŸš› Canadian Nuclear Laboratories - Vehicle State Monitoring Challenge

Telligence is an Arduino-based platform designed for real-time monitoring of vehicle and container conditions during nuclear waste transport.
Built on the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, it integrates multiple sensors to detect crashes, vibrations, temperature, humidity, and simulated radiation leaks â€” helping ensure safety and environmental protection during high-risk transport operations.

- Implemented Hazard Level Check system to assign score based on issues detected in sensors
